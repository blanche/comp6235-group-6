Meeting with Elena

what our story should be:
	1) analysis of public opinion (google vs yelp vs justeat)
	2) analysis of public vs authorities

important: we have to explain results
	why does it (not) correlate
		less data?
		geographical location?
		more fast food?
		specific categories?
		reviews worse in this area?
		public health is taken more serious?
		chains rated consistently over councils?
		is price a factor?
		how are the three sub ratings (management, x, x) correlate 

sentiment analysis not feasible for our use case
	better try topic modeling on the text
	how are high rated/low rated rated restaurants mentioned

presentation:
	1) start with story
		story we found, it is interesting because this and this
	2) go through how we did it
		what where the problems (lessens learned)
		in a technical perspective
	3) highlight findings again

	audience should take away:
		what are the findings
		how did we do it
