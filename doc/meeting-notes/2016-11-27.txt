meeting notes 2016/11/27

VM was created
	Lukas will set up Mongo db an send out connection

	client = MongoClient("svm-lw4u16-comp6235-group-6.ecs.soton.ac.uk", 27018)
	client.restaurants.authenticate('user', 'banana4')

data store architecture
	each collector stores each own data structure and syncs into an overall collection
	overall collection stores
		FHRSID
			justeat
				(id?)
				avg rating
				food rating
				delivery rating
				service rating
			google
				id
				rating
				type
				(anything else?)
			yelp
				id
				rating
				review_count
				categories
				price
			hygiene data
				rating
				type
				local authority
				rating date
				name
				scores
				postcode
				geocode

each implementation has to provide functionality to
	- load data
	- clean data
	- sync data into to overall collection
	- matched/not matched and count statistics


Analyze
	rating vs price
	rating vs hygiene
	price vs hygiene
	region vs region
	chains vs each other vs region
	google/justeat/yelp vs each other

	do correlation analysis (e.g. R value) 


todos:
	- create heat map in d3 
	- normalize scores for 1-5
	- normalize price for 1-5
	- do correlation analysis on previous questions

	till tonight
		- merge existing code to master
		- put stuff into overall

	next meeting on the 31.11 1100:
		- import as much data as possible in agreed structure
		- start correlation analysis
