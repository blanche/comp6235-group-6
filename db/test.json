I like the kind of place when something goes wrong they fix it and they did: we ordered a bottle of wine, it wasn't fresh so they gave us a free glass of wine each to wait for our bottle. I'm happy. Food was really really good! The milkshake was the best I ever had!\nWe will be back!",

After being assured by the waitress (who didn't seem to give a damn) that an extra patty would be included in the meal deal, we found the 2.95 charge on the bill at the end. Again the waitress didn't care, simply telling us it was \"written on the menu\". Felt conned and lied to, also the rose tasted vile and cost 4.95 for a small glass.",
